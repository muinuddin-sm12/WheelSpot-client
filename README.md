# WheelSpot (A car shop)

## Project Overview

The Wheelspot is a responsive e-commerce platform that allows users to view, search, and purchase cars. It also provides a role-based authentication system with user and admin roles. Admins can manage products, users, and orders, while regular users can view product details, place orders, and manage their profiles.

### UI/UX Design
